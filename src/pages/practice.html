    <br>
    <p>As a competitive team, we hold regular practices two hours a day, five days a week. Practices are mandatory; as a club sport with no formal coach, we grow by learning from each other and fencing each other. However, we do understand that sometimes missing practices is unavoidable, as midterms, papers, and projects are plentiful for all of us. Academics always come first, and we understand the need to miss practices occasionally for this reason. However, we ask that team members notify the captains and limit their reasons for missing practice to only academic ones.</p>
		<p>Our team consists of fencers of varying levels, but we all practice together in three squads divided by weapon: foil, epee, and sabre. Men and women fence together in practice, but compete in tournaments as separate teams. Our practices include conditioning, footwork, bladework, drills, and open bouting with electrical equipment. Practice times and locations will be posted and kept updated on this page.</p>

      	<p>DCFC has the privilege of owning a fully stocked armory, complete with extra weapons, masks, cords, jackets, and other fencing equipment. Designed by Tan Chen ’11 and Scott Brookes ’14 in 2011, the armory provides a space for fencers to store, clean, and fix their equipment. We also have extra equipment for prospective members interested in trying fencing out—no need to buy the whole outfit for just fall term!</p>
				<p>Located in Alumni Gym, the armory is normally kept locked, accessible only by members of the fencing team. If you are interested in coming by or using our equipment to fence, please contact the captains via email at Fencing.Club@dartmouth.edu.</p>
