    <p>As a competitive team, we hold regular practices, two hours a day, five days a week. Practices are mandatory; we grow by learning from each other and fencing each other. However, we do understand that sometimes, missing practices is unavoidable. As students at an Ivy League school focusing on increasing academic rigor, midterms, papers, and projects are plentiful for all of us. Academics always come first, and as such, we understand the need to miss practices occasionally for academics. However, we also do not condone skipping practices without first notifying the captains beforehand with a good reason.</p>

	<p>Our team consists of fencers of varying levels, but we all practice together in three squads divided by weapon: foil, epee, and sabre. Men and women practice together, but compete in tournaments as separate teams. Our practices include conditioning, footwork, bladework, drills, and open bouting with electrical equipment.
	 Practice times and locations will be posted and kept updated on this page.</p>

      	<p>DCFC has the privilege of owning a fully stocked armory, complete with extra weapons, masks, cords, jackets, and other fencing paraphernalia. Designed by Tan Chen ’11 and Scott Brookes ’14 in 2011, the armory provides a space for fencers to store, clean, and fix their equipment. We also have extra equipment for prospective members interested in trying fencing out.</p>

		<p>Located in Alumni Gym, the armory is normally kept locked, accessible only by members of the fencing team. If you are interested in coming by or using our equipment to fence, please contact the captains via email at Fencing.Club@dartmouth.edu</p>
